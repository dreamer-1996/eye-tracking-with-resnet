[sample list for eye image] We used eye images for the evaluation in our paper [1].
We randomly picked 1,500 left eye and 1,500 right eye from each participant where these eyes may come from the different faces, and all right eye are flipped.
[annotation for face image] We used face patch for the evaluation in our paper [2].
To make the evaluation in [2] comparable with [1], we picked the faces corresponding to the left eye of each participant, and flipped the face for all samples corresponding to the right eye. In this case, we use the same image for [1] and [2] and still 3,000 samples for each participants.
